INTRODUCTION

This is words, a Latin-to English dictionary program, by William
Whitaker (whitaker@erols.com). It takes keyboard input or a file of
Latin text lines and provides an analysis of each word individually.
Versions with "E" in the name also provide English-to-Latin
functionality.

It uses the following files: INFLECT.SEC, UNIQUES.LAT, ADDONS.LAT,
STEMFILE.GEN, INDXFILE.GEN, DICTFILE.GEN, EWDSFILE.GEN.

BACKGROUND

This program was written in Ada, and originally designed for
DOS/Windows PCs.  I first ported it to Linux in early 1999 using
gnat 3.10p (Ada compiler) on an Intel PC running RedHat Linux 5.2.
I re-compiled it in May 2000 using gnat 3.12p on a RedHat 6.0 machine. 
Most recently, I ported version 1.97Ed to Linux and FreeBSD in 
February 2006 using gnat 3.40 on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 and FreeBSD 4.10, 
respectively.

Please report to me (bdragoo@thomasaquinas.edu) any successes and failures 
running `words' on another *NIX distribution or platform  and I will post 
the information here.  I'm not a programmer, so I'm not sure whether I 
compiled the program in a manner universal enough to run on systems beyond 
those on which I've had a chance to test them.

However, porting words to any *NIX is quite simple, so if my ports 
don't work on your machine, you might have better success porting them 
yourself.  Below is a link to the author's development page where you can 
find the source code and instructions for compilation.  Please feel free 
to email me for help in compiling if you have any trouble.

LATEST

The latest Linux and FreeBSD releases as of February 17, 2006 are: 
words-1.97Ed-<version>.tar.gz (3.0 MB), where <version> is either
`linux' or `freebsd'.

This and older versions of words for Linux and FreeBSD are available from:

    ftp://ftp1.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words/


Information about the program, current releases, and the words program
on other platforms can be found at:

INSTALLATION

Words may be installed by a single user on any Linux or FreeBSD system, 
or it can be installed system-wide by an administrator for use by all 
users on the system.

Administrators wishing to make words available to all users on a system 
should do something like this:  move the tar.gz file to an appropriate
directory for software (e.g. /usr/local/) then execute the following command:

    tar zxvf words-1.xx-<version>.tar.gz

This results in a directory (/usr/local/words-1.xx) with about 18 MB of files
which contains the following: 

    README
    INFLECT.SEC
    UNIQUES.LAT
    ADDONS.LAT
    STEMFILE.GEN
    INDXFILE.GEN
    DICTFILE.GEN
    EWDSFILE.GEN
    latin
    words
    wordsdoc.htm


Individual users can simply perform the above steps in their own home 
directory.

POST-INSTALLATION

After installing, you could run the words program by changing to the 
directory that has these zipped files 
(e.g. /usr/local/words-1.xx, or ~/words-1.xx), and executing the command:

    ./words

However, since you probably don't want to cd into this directory every
time you run words, I've included a simple shell script (suggested to me 
by Johannes Tevessen <johannes.tevessen@xlink.net>) that changes into the
words directory (e.g., /usr/local/words-1.xx), then runs the words
binary from there as a subtask.  On my system, I call the script `latin',
so that it's easy for my students to remember, but you can rename it
whatever you'd like.  It is as follows:

	#! /usr/local/bin/bash           # my bash location
	WORDSPATH=/usr/local/words-1.xx  # directory of words executable
	( cd $WORDSPATH ; ./words $* )

You should put this shell script in one of your bin directories in
your path (mine is in /usr/local/bin) and change it to reflect your 
installation directory (also, be sure the first line points to your bash 
shell). Then to run words, all you do is type `latin' at any prompt, 
and it will execute words for you, and exit gracefully.

I had to include this script because the program needs to be in its own
directory to know where to find its supporting files.  Creating a link
(ln) to the words program doesn't quite work.  Neither does putting
the whole `words' directory in your path. Remember, this program was
ported from DOS without any change in the source code, so it has some
DOS quirkyness.  Perhaps someone would like to write an install
script so that you don't have to do all of this stuff manually.  If so,
email it to me, and I will include it with the program.

DISCLAIMER: I had nothing to do with the writing of this program.  I
only ported it to Linux and FreeBSD.  Email me (bdragoo@thomasaquinas.edu)
with any port-related questions; email Whitaker (whitaker@erols.com) with
any program-related questions.
